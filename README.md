## 🏗 Architecture / Technical Design


## 🗄 Data Model
The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents the database structure of the personal finance management system. The data model consists of three main entities: User, Transaction, and Category.

## 🔄 Flowchart
The sequence diagram illustrates how users interact with the personal finance management system. Users begin by logging in or registering using Firebase Authentication. Once authenticated, the system retrieves and stores user data, transactions, and categories using the Firebase database, and displays the dashboard for navigation. The diagram shows the sequence of actions for managing transactions, categories, viewing expense visualizations, and securely logging out.
